So, I finally caved in and made one of those blog things that all the cool kids seem to have. I cannot promise much by way of eloquence, but hopefilly I can put something interesting here from time to time. The blog, as I am sure is obvious, is made using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), which seems nice so far. I'm quite enjoying being able to write this from VIM instead of some grotty in-browser WYSIWYG editor.
